# Important Note

Our backend is hosted by a free version of Render, a web service platform. This means that when the backend has inactivity, itll turn off and will turn on in around a minute after the first API call. This means that if the app has had inactivities for more than an hour, please wait around a minute after pressing on the Login or Register action buttons, let the render backend turn on, then use the application again, there should be no issues after then.
